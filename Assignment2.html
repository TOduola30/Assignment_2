    <p>You can refine your skills and improve your workflow with every
        <br> task by applying your knowledge to practical experiences. 
        <br> The skills you learn and apply are transferable, and they can increase 
        <br> your marketability and advance your career by appealing to 
        <br> potential employers.

    </p>You can also consider applying them independently to create

    <p>Many brands operate a relaxed dress policy (we do at Ciphr for 
        <br>office-based staff). You don’t need to come to work every day in
        <br>a 3 piece suit, just spruce yourself up a bit with a casual shirt and
        <br>trousers.
        <br>The same goes for footwear, scruffy two year old trainers
        <br> can be replaced with a pair of casual shoes.</p>

        <h3>Get social on and offline</h3>
        <p> Getting to know your colleagues socially is a great way to learn 
        <br nospace> how people tick, but also to strike up new friendships.
        <br nospace> It’s often the case that people will work better together if they 
        <br nospace> socialise as well. Connecting with colleagues on social media 
        <br nospace> helps you and them to bond and become more cohesive as a team.</p>
        <section>
        <h3>Be proactive and ‘give it a go’</h3>
        <p> Pushing yourself and getting out of your comfort zone’s a good way to learn 
        <br>new skills and become more confident. Speaking at the company meeting, 
        <br>attending customer events or meeting clients in person, whatever it is, 
        <br>offer your services and don’t wait to be asked, people will notice your pro-active nature.</p>

        <p>When you connect with others that share similar interests in the 
        <br>tech industry, you're building your professional network. 
        <br>Attending local conferences, contributing to online tech forums 
        <br>and talking to local professionals are all effective methods to 
        <br>expand your tech industry connections.</p>
